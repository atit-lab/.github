## Hi there from the Atit Lab ðŸ‘‹

We are a developmental biology lab, focusing on dermal fibrosis, cranial bone formation, and skin development, which are all bound together by Wnt signalling. We recently started writing our own code to aide our analyses, where needed. Feel free to peruse and try some of our things out :)
