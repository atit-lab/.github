## Hi there from the Atit Lab 👋

We are a developmental biology lab, focusing on dermal fibrosis, cranial bone formation, and skin development, which are all bound together by Wnt signalling. We recently started using Computer Science to aide our analyses. Feel free to peruse and try some of our things out :).
