## Hi there from the Atit Lab ðŸ‘‹

We are located at Case Western Reserve University's Department of Biology and focus on mammalian craniofacial and skin development and disease. We have a history of students winning awards for presentations both on campus and nationally. To learn more, visit http://www.case.edu/artsci/biology/atitlab. 

On lab fun days, we enjoy spending time on the Case Quad, playing lawn games or going to Mitchell's ice cream for a quick snack. 

We recently started writing our own code to aide our analyses where needed. Feel free to peruse and try some of our programs out :)
