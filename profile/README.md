## Hi there from the Atit Lab ðŸ‘‹

Atit Lab is a trainee-friendly group in the Millis Building in the Biology Department at Case Western Reserve University (@cwru). We study craniofacial skin and bone development in the mouse embryo. We are specifically interested in the genetic program and the development of the embryonic dermis and cranial bones. Projects in the lab focus on various early development and postnatal aspects relating to dermal or cranial bone cell fate, origin, and differentiation. We are also developing new genetic mouse models for skin fibrosis to identify new ways to reverse established scarring.

Our lab has two main branches of research: the craniofacial group and the skin biology group. We have worked on lineage tracing, role of Wnt signaling in cranial lineage decisions and calvarial bone cell fate. More recently we are working on calvarial apical expansion and the role of substrates in cell movement and disease. On the skin side, we have worked on dermal fibroblast cell fate, role of wnt signaling in dermal fibroblasts development and hair follicle initiation. Recently, we are working on Wnt signaling in dermal fibrosis and adipocyte depletion in skin fibrosis.

We have a history of students winning awards and doing presentations both on campus and nationally. To learn more about us, visit http://www.case.edu/artsci/biology/atitlab. 

On lab fun days, we enjoy spending time on the Case Quad, playing lawn games or going to Mitchell's ice cream for a quick snack. 

We recently started writing our own code to aide our analyses where needed. Feel free to peruse and try some of our programs out :)
